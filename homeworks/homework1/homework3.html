	I am fine. No, that was an understatement. Actually, I am feeling phenomenal good. Every day I can decide on how to spend my time, completely free without restrictions1. The water I’m drinking is extraordinarily clean and, even more importantly, free of germs, bacteria, and pathogens. Also, don’t have to worry where to get my food for the next day. My civil rights are being protected by a state that allows me to express my opinion (freedom of speech) without having to fear prosecution. Our children are rising up without war and famines and have the chance to get an excellent education.<br>
	Have you noticed something at this point? I, you and all the other people that read these lines have a hundred times easier, safer and better life than millions of other people from third world countries will ever be able to experience.

	Have you ever noticed the fact that slum dwellers in third world countries are often even happier as thousands of residents in our civilization, even though to the fact that they lack so many things from food to luxury articles like a TV? Could it be that these people appreciate their lives a lot more, due to the fact of not being able to know whether they are able to enjoy the next day? Perhaps they don’t even focus on material things or tangibles like money, instead, they enjoy the time with their family and esteem social values like deep friendships by far more than we do?
